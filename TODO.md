# TODO

## Cleanup

- [ ] - Consolidate colour pallettes used across the project. CSS files -> into `tailwind.config.ts`
- [ ] - Ensure all base `page.tsx` files and any potential `layout.tsx` files are _**NOT**_ marked as 'use client', unless _absolutely_ necessary. (Even then we should be moving the state reliance to child components)
- [ ] - Remove or simplify similar or duplicate (mostly inline) funcitons where possible to `lib/` or `hooks/` as semi-generic implementations.

- [ ] - Consolidate repeat or ad-hoc types into the `types/` directory.
- [ ] - Take consolidated types and remove type duplication. Prefer moving into simple, but generic types/interfaces.
